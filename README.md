# game-ai-samples
A series of AI projects showing pathfinding, decision making, and minimax. All projects use a Java game framework I built using Swing.


**INSTALLATION GUIDE**
Inside the source code folder are folders for each sample project. Open the folder for the title to install as a project within IntelliJ or any other IDE. From here, you should simply have to compile the code and it will run though you may need to target the assets folder as the resources folder depending on your environment. For further guidance, check the PDF in the documentation folder.

In addition .jar files are provided to run the samples without having to recompile the source code.
